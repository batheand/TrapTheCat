for graphics, change actual numbers first, and update screen after each change to check if cats and blocks are ok

end conditions
check every neighbor of cat if there are no valid moves, blocker end condition
check if the cat is on the edge of the map, if so, cat end condition







gameplay:
initialize map,
place cat,
refresh screen
give turn to player
record blocked tile
refresh screen
action of cat by ai
refresh screen
do until end conditions
put whole thing in loop and give choice at end conditions to retun to main menu, exit or retry


ai:
create distance to win value for each square
edges get 1
each square adjacent to a 1 gets 2, 2 gets 3

create poss routes
distance to win=1 gets route of 2

others get sum of routes with smaller distance to wins


best for cat is highest score which is route/distance

add difficulty variable
