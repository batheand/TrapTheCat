for graphics, change actual numbers first, and update screen after each change to check if cats and blocks are ok





ai:
create distance to win value for each square
next to edges get 1
each square adjacent to a 1 gets 2, 2 gets 3






create poss routes
distance to win=1 gets route of 2

others get sum of routes with smaller distance to wins


best for cat is highest score which is route/distance

add difficulty variable





dtw assignment;
{negcheck
check dtw(i) tiles negs, if none are dtw(current-1), dtw++

loop
x,y 11-i,1+i assign dtwi if unblocked, if i>0 negcheck, if i==0, routes=1
this
}

routes assignment;{
loop
start from i=1
x,y 11-i,1+i, find negs with lesser dtw, routes is the sum of their routes
this
}





 check how many dtw0 negs dtw1 tile has, assign that to routes,

  if(coordianteX==2 || coordianteX==10|| coordinateY==2|| coordinateY==10){
             distanceToWin=1;
             routes=2;
         }
