both the ai and player cat can sometimes traverse thorough blocked objects(tiles that should return being blocked return false to being blocked)


not an actual bug but there is literally 0 exception handling, lots of trust on the user to follow commands.


we can move to originally blocked ones but not ones that have been blocked by the user as the multiplayer cat
