ai has difficulty when using routes methods, especially on later iterations as opposed to the first
both the ai and player cat can sometimes traverse thorough blocked objects(tiles that should return being blocked return false to being blocked)
the game doesnt end when blocker win condition is met, due to the false return issue mentioner

not an actual bug but there is literally 0 exception handling, lots of trust on the user to follow commands.
